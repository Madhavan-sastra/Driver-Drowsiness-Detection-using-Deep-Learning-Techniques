Driver drowsiness detection systems have gained significant attention in recent years due to their potential to prevent accidents caused by sleepy or distracted drivers. In this project, we propose a solution utilizing Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (DCNN) for real-time drowsiness detection. The system operates by continuously analyzing the driver's facial features and eye movements captured through a camera mounted inside the vehicle. The DCNN model is trained on a dataset containing a wide range of facial expressions and eye states, including open eyes, closed eyes, and various levels of drowsiness.Upon detecting signs of drowsiness, such as prolonged eye closure or unusual facial expressions indicative of fatigue, the system triggers an alarm to alert the driver. Additionally, to ensure timely intervention, the system sends alert emails to the driver's registered Gmail account and SMS messages to a predefined phone number of a close relation or emergency contact.The proposed system offers a comprehensive approach to mitigate the risks associated with driver drowsiness, providing both auditory and digital alerts to prompt the driver to take necessary precautions or breaks, thereby enhancing road safety.
